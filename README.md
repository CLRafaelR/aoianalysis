This package is a work in progress. Please contact Nicole Burke (nicoleburke@uchicago.edu) to discuss how your data should be set-up. 

## Notes for me

When data is entered: 

- the subjects column needs to read as a factor or the functions won't work 
- need to get rid of NAs or the functions won't work 
- these functions work for each unique trial type
